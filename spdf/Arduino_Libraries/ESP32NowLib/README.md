# ESP32NOWLib Documentation
This is a library for working with ESP-Now with ESP32 in Arduino IDE. Currently only supports single master and multiple slaves with unicast (master sends to multiple slaves, master does not listen for messages and slaves does not send messages).

## Usage
This library was tested with 3 ESP32 Dev C modules, with 1 being a master and 2 being slave nodes. Master can send same message to all or just message to one slave.

## Example
Add this library to your Arduino library, and if you are using Arduino IDE you can check examples at File->Examples or just copy and paste the ino files inside the examples folder.
