# ROS-GUI Documentation
Created a simple ROS-GUI proto-type with HTML and CSS as front-end and a ROSLibJS for connecting to ROS. Also as I had to use ROS Noetic which at my internship time only supported Ubuntu 20.04 (I used PopOS 22.04 at the time) so therefore I decided to use ROS Docker rather than a VM. The GUI can control the movement of the robot and view the camera stream of the robot.

## Using the Docker Image

## Setting up on the ROS side



## Footnote
Docker is good to use for quick testing and portability but can be a bit of a pain to set up with ROS especially if you need to GPU.
