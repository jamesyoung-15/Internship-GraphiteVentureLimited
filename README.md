# Internship at XDreamVenture Limited
My work during my internship with XDreamVenture Limited as an IoT intern. Most of my work there was to help with developing water sensors but was also assigned various other tasks.

## SFDF Sensors
Worked on reading sensor data from various water sensors (eg. pH, DO, etc.) and sending those data to AWS. Sensor data obtained through ESP32 microcontroller and data sent to AWS through a SIM7600G module. Mainly worked on the software side with Arduino libraries.

Main Arduino code: [sfdf.ino](https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/XDreamVenture-Intern/blob/main/spdf/sfdf.ino)

Documentation: [Link](https://github.com/jamesyoung-15/XDreamVenture-Intern/blob/main/spdf/README.md)

## Simple ROS GUI
Worked on a simple ROS GUI example to control ROS robot with virtual joystick and display camera stream. Mainly uses roslibjs for connecting to ROS and website uses basic HTML, CSS, and javascript.
